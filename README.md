# LUNCH SPOTS API 🍔 🥗 🍕 🍛 🍣 🥤
## Introducing a solution to the age-old question <br> ✨ "WHERE SHOULD WE GO FOR LUNCH?" ✨

## ▶️ Overview
Lunch Spots API is a simple service built in ASP.NET Core, designed to let users maintain a list of lunch spots and most
importantly, decide where to eat. This project is intended for Leonie's learning purposes, utilising CRUD operations, 
JSON-based data storage, and dotnet API best practices.

## 💾 Data 

The "database" for this project is a simple JSON file, `lunchspots.json`, where all lunch spot records are stored. While 
this is not as robust as a true database, it’s a start.

Each lunch spot includes following information:
```json
{
  "Name": "Boots", 
  "PriceRange": "$",
  "AveragePortionSize": "small",
  "MinutesWalkAway": 4,
  "SuitableForLeonie": true,
  "SuitableForSahir": true,
  "SuitableForJanet": true
}
```
